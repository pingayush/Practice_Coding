Dry Run


Since i is range (2,6)                          Since j is in range (1,11)
starting point of i is 2                        starting point of j is 1

2                                               1
therefore

2*1=2
2*2=4
2*3=6
2*4+8
2*5=10
2*6=12
2*7=14
2*8=16
2*9=18
2*10=20                                      J will stop as the upperlimit of j is 11 which exclusive in the bracket


3                                              1
therfore

3*1=3
3*2=6
3*3=9
3*4+12
3*5=15
3*6=18
3*7=21
3*8=24
3*9=27
3*10=30                                      J will stop as the upperlimit of j is 11 which exclusive in the bracket



4                                               1
4*1=4
4*2=8
4*3=12
4*4=16
4*5=20
4*6=24
4*7=28
4*8=32
4*9=36
4*10=40                                      J will stop as the upperlimit of j is 11 which exclusive in the bracket






5                                               1
5*1=5
5*2=4
5*3=6
5*4+8
5*5=10
5*6=12
5*7=14
5*8=16
5*9=18
5*10=20                                      J will stop as the upperlimit of j is 11 which exclusive in the bracket

  I will stop as the upperlimit of i is 6 which exclusive in the bracket


  Hence the loop breaks
